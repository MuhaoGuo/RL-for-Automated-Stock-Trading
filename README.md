# RL-for-Automated-Stock-Trading\
Automated stock trading is a popular topic of in- vestment. Recent work has shown the success of machine learning techniques in predicting stock prices. This work explores different automated trading algorithms based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models. Five independent Actor-Critic (A2C/DDPG/PPO/TD3/SAC) algorithms and one ensemble learning method are considered, with maximum portfolio value as the target of Reinforcement Learning (RL) reward function. To find out the indicatorâ€™s performance, we compare the results of the algorithms with and without indicators. Experiment results show that indicator is effective to predict. These DRL-based algorithms show their effective- ness by outperforming Dow Jones Industrial Average index, evaluated by the Sharpe ratio.
